  <p>Dev Log 1: Serena Shafer â€“ Team Lead, Art Producer
Hi Everyone! Serena here! I just wanted to post a Dev Log about progress with Left Hook that we are currently making! 
For the past several weeks, we have been in a ideation / pre-production stage for a vertical slice of what we want Left Hook to look like. This week we actually started the development for the project. The design team finalized designs for the gameplay loop. The art team started working on finalized sprite assets that are going to be used in game. The tech team worked on finishing a functional gameplay loop for the game, with some bugs popping up. Finally, myself and the Tech Producer, Stanley, worked on a presentation that we will be sharing in our next group meeting summarizing our progress and our next steps.
One of the biggest challenges we have had so far is using Perforce. One of the requirements for this project, as stated by our program director, is that we have to use Perforce as our version control system. However, there have been many glitches and we have not been able to set it up. The past several weeks, we have been trying to set it up using help from a TA, a professor, and even contacting our program director. This has caused our tech team to fall behind in our schedule. 
During our tech meeting, I made the executive decision to switch to Github instead of trying to continue to make Perforce work for our team. I wanted to cut our losses and not loose any more progress due to a technical issue when there was another version control program we could use instead. The tech team really started to make some progress in their work that we have not seen since the beginning of the term. 
I know there are probably going to be consequences to going directly against the rules that our program director set in place. Because of this, when I informed Adrian of this decision, I also let him know that this was my decision as a team leader and that I should be the person to serve those consequences instead of the tech team. I made the call so I should take responsibility for any consequences that happen because of it! 
There will be more updates the weeks progress but I wanted to leave it here on a fish joke:
Where do fish go on vacation? Finland
